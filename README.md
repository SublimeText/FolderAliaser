# Folder Aliaser

Alias your project folders quickly and easily! Right-click on any top-level folder in the Side Bar and choose "Alias
Folder".

This plugin works by **modifying your current `sublime-project` file**. Specifically, it edits the `name` property of
items in the `folders` array. If this is an issue, then the current version of this plugin won't work for you.

# Installation
When it's finished and I publish it, install via Package Control ([installation instructions](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) and [usage guide](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/usage)).

# Usage
Right-click on any top-level folder in the Side Bar, choose "Alias Folder", and type the alias you want. Simple!

# Contributions, issues, questions, etc.

# License
The code is free to use. This is my first Sublime Text plugin so there are a ton of comments. Should be pretty easy to follow.
