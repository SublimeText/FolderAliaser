# Folder Aliaser

Alias your project folders quickly and easily! Right-click on any top-level folder in the Side Bar and choose "Alias
Folder".

This plugin works by **modifying your current `sublime-project` file**. Specifically, it edits the `name` property of
items in the `folders` array. If this is an issue, then the current version of this plugin won't work for you.

# Known Issues

* After entering an alias, the Side Bar refreshes and collapses previously expanded folders.
