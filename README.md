# Folder Aliaser

Alias your project folders quickly and easily! Right-click on any top-level folder in the Side Bar and select the new
"Alias Folder" option.

This plugin works by **modifying your current `sublime-project` file**. Specifically, it edits items in the `folders`
array. The only attribute which is modified is adding / editing / removing `name`. If this is an issue, then the current
version of this plugin won't work for you.
