# Folder Aliaser

Alias your project folders quickly and easily! Right-click on any top-level folder in the Side Bar and choose "Alias
Folder".

This plugin works by **modifying your current `sublime-project` file**. Specifically, it edits the `name` property of
items in the `folders` array. If this is an issue, then the current version of this plugin won't work for you.

The code is free to use. This is my first Sublime Text plugin so there are a ton of comments. Should be pretty easy to follow.
